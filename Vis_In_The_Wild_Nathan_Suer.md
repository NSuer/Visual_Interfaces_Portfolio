## Purpose of the visualization
<!-- What is the purpose of this visualization?  -->
The purpose of this visualization is to provide an interactive tool for users to explore and learn about asteroids, their orbits, and potential impacts with Earth. The visualization aims to educate the public about near-Earth objects (NEOs) and promote interest in astronomy and asteroid research.

## Data
<!-- What is the data?  How was the data captured or collected? -->
The data used to create this visualization is from the Ceneter for Near-Earth Object Studies and the NASA Jet Propulsion Labratory's Solar Systems Dynamics website (https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/). The data includes information about the orbits, sizes, and classifications of asteroids, as well as their close approaches to Earth. This data is collected through various telescopes, space missions that track and monitor NEOs, and mathematical models that predict their trajectories.

## Users
<!-- Who are the users that this visualization was made for?  Experts, general public, children, patients, mechanics, athletes+trainers...?   -->
The intended users for this visalization are the general public, educators, and students. The visualization is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, allowing people of all ages and backgrounds to explore and learn about asteroids and their significance in our solar system. It can also be used by educators as a teaching tool in classrooms to engage students in astronomy and planetary science.

## AI Use
I used github copilot to help me write this assignment. I didn't prompt it with anything spedcific, but I let it autocomplete my sentances and help me write the assignment. I also used it to help me write the markdown for this assignment. I did not use any other AI tools for this assignment. I made edits after it autocompleted.
